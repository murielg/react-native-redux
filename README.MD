# React Native and Redux Apps

- For Projects created with `create-react-app` use EXPO, otherwise try the following:

Install React Native CLI with `npm install -g react-native-cli`

Install dependencies with `yarn install`

Watch and develop with `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android`

- `⌘+R` Reload iOS Simulator or `R+R` Reload Android Simulator 
  - You can also enable live reloading, and debug JS remotely in your browser. Just open the development menu, `⌘+M ` for android and `⌘+D` for iOS.
  
 

### Troubleshooting

`npm start` and then try opening Xcode or Android Studio, open the respective project corresponding to your choice of OS, and build/run from inside your IDE.

Upgrading also seems to resolve some build issues [Upgrade React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/upgrading.html)
